## Introduction

### What is Prime Launch?

Prime Launch is a platform to host reliable and fair token launches on Ethereum — designed for teams who need simplicity, speed, and performance. It’s powered by Balancer v2 and other custom contracts, and it’s carefully curated by the Master Badge holders of [Prime Rating](https://www.prime.xyz/rating).

- Project teams and DAOs can use Prime Launch to seamlessly attract resources and distribute tokens to a wide audience of contributors in a completely web3 native way.
- Users looking to acquire tokens can get access to emerging projects curated by Prime Rating, a network of web3 researchers orchestrated by PrimeDAO.

### Prime Launch: IDOs made better

With the advancement of decentralized finance, an increasing number of crypto projects have shifted from listing tokens on centralized exchanges to listing on decentralized exchanges. With this transition, new mechanisms for market-making and token offerings have emerged. These mechanisms are generally called **Initial Decentralized Offerings (IDOs)**. IDOs have removed many frictions from the industry as projects no longer need to wait (or pay) for centralized exchanges to list their assets, and as a consequence, this has allowed a more diverse group of Web3 projects to emerge.

While IDOs remove some friction to token launches, they also create new type of challenges, namely:

- They require time and money to research available IDO tools and in most cases to develop custom interfaces and contracts;
- They normally have large initial capital requirements depending on the protocol
- They suffer from exploits like [*front-running*](https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/research/decrypt/arbitrage-and-frontrunning-in-defi) and [*sandwich attacks*](https://hackernoon.com/no-sandwich-please-popular-defi-attack-strategy-analysis-jk1734rf).
- They suffer from poor curation or total lack of curation on the part of decentralized exchange interfaces, making it difficult for users to find reputable new projects.

Prime Launch provides DAOs with ready-to-use launch infrastructure: low initial capital requirements, smooth UX, and a relevant network of users.

### How is Prime Launch different?

The first question most people have is, of course, how is Prime Launch different from everything else out there? Here’s a table to give you a quick summary:

In short, other open platforms are generally difficult to use or don't give you off-the-shelf control & ownership of your launches. Prime Launch provides the best tradeoff between design simplicity and decentralized ownership.

### Prime Launch Features

**Prime Launch** is designed to simplify the workflow of DAO incumbents and new players who want to offer their tokens or bootstrap liquidity by reducing the cost and effort of doing so. 

We deploy **security mechanisms** to minimize or eliminate the risk for you and your contributors. Launch provides a fair share of **configuration and compliance options** for DAOs to adopt in their token offering. With our foolproof UX we have streamlined **safe and effective** ways to adopt otherwise complex smart contracts and escrow mechanisms – and we do so with an **extremely friendly business model** that has a grow-the-pie approach in which we both have skin-in-the-game in each others’ projects. 

Our **permissioned, curated approach** to projects that want to get listed and use Launch has one main objective: always **ensure quality launches for DAOs and their contributors**. Project administrators can follow our comprehensive documentation and tutorials, alongside a dedicated human support.

Prime Launch’s decentralized and curated token offering platform is powered by Balancer v2 and it’s **available on Ethereum and Arbitrum**. Prime Launch will soon feature our own custom open-source contracts for Celo and Gnosis Chain developed [in partnership with Symmetric](https://medium.com/primedao/symmetric-primedao-working-together-to-accelerate-the-dao-ecosystem-on-celo-and-gnosis-chain-4fac91b38200). All these contracts are thoroughly audited and are designed to enable fair and effective token launches.

With every launch, we are ready to support DAOs with dedicated in-house and third-party support services thanks to our strong partnerships. For a list and full breakdown of these services see here (TODO add anchor).

Our cross-functional team constantly identifies potentially harmful architectural and operational risks in all of our Prime products, and our interfaces and protocols are shipped to maximize the autonomy and agency of our users and partners, especially in executing damage control operations (e.g. pausing the sale in case of some issue).

### Types of Launch

As of today, Prime Launch allows you to create two types of launch:

🌱 **Seed Launch**, a simple way to host a decentralized token offering to raise early investments at a fixed price.

🌊 **Liquid Launch** allowing a project to conduct a fair, market-based discovery of their token price and to boost its already existing liquidity.

🌱 **Seed Launch** allows early-stage projects to host a launch without needing to pre-allocate any resources and with the ability to select which contributors are able to participate.

**Benefits:**

- *Decentralized:* Prime Launch uses decentralized infrastructure and is run by PrimeDAO contributors
- *Simplified:* pre-determined maximum amount raised & quantity of tokens sold
- *Allowlist:* projects can optionally specify which addresses are allowed to invest in the seed launch
- *Vesting:* projects can set vesting and cliff periods for contributors

🌊 **Liquid Launch** leverages the [Balancer V2](https://docs.balancer.fi/) infrastructure. It uses a novel token distribution mechanism, the Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP), to disincentivize large contributors from buying all tokens in one go and to punish bots, leading to more fair and accessible distributions.

**Benefits:**

- *Decentralized*: Prime Launch uses decentralized infrastructure and is run by PrimeDAO core contributors
- *Capital-efficient:* LBPs help distribute more tokens at efficient price points with less initial capital
- *Fair*: LBPs' constant downward price pressure disincentivizes front-running (a market manipulation practice) and large buys from whales, giving better opportunities to your intended early contributors
- *Multi-asset:* smart order routing means that users can trade any token in exchange for the project token at the price of higher slippage (using Balancer on the back end)
- *Multi-use:* it allows you to configure your launch to segue into another use-case (e.g to serve as a 50/50 AMM after the initial sale)

<!-- 

### Background

The rise of decentralized technologies has unleashed unprecedented opportunities for individuals and collectives to co-found, own and govern digitally-native organizations. Formulating and organizing around shared principles, capacities, and resources, the successful recipe for any collaborative network, is now easier than ever.

People are neither natural cooperators nor competitive, cutthroat rationalists - they respond to the incentives in front of them. DAOs unlock cooperative ways of organizing new institutions, and by doing so they help dissolve the monopoly on ownership by a limited class of super-managers and investor elites.

**Prime equips DAOs with all the tools and resources they need to thrive.** Each DAO’s lifecycle, from initiation to growth, to maturity has been given careful consideration ([explore our other products](https://www.prime.xyz/)).

PrimeDAO enables cooperation with DAO tooling on a greater scale than previously possible, acknowledging, compensating, and recognizing the multiple stakeholders necessary to make any human venture successful - including those traditionally neglected in existing incentive structures.

You may find yourself drawn to Prime’s mission and products, and want to participate in PrimeDAO as a co-creator. You are welcome to [reach out to us](https://discord.com/invite/primedao) if these values resonate with you as well.

This is what drives us daily, and what we expect from you:

- **Radical purpose:** Doing what is right is at the core. Speaking and acting with candid care and purpose. Feedback is sharp, yet thoughtful.
- **Open:** Building in the open and with others. Productively stewarding key DAO ecosystem primitives while leveraging existing building blocks.
- **Collaborative:** Doing everything as a team. This practically means being on calls across teams, and communicating across distances. We are shared owners who are responsible to each other.
- **Adaptive:** Being action-oriented, experimental, and creator-minded. Web3 changes fast: we should too.
- **Accommodative:** Willing to help, forgive mistakes, and welcome others. Good collaborators ask without assuming and seek understanding without judgment. If we can’t do this, wngmi.
- **Knowledge sharing:** We aim to extend our knowledge to the network and are fundamentally curious about the world around us.

# <!--CORE CONCEPTS & FAQs-->

### Why should I use Prime Launch for my token launch?

When you use Prime Launch, the Prime Network is buying into your launch and makes a number of other services and products available to you, such as shared liquidity pooling, R&D, developing, and communications support (see the [Prime Forum](https://forum.prime.xyz/)). This will increase your chances of a successful launch, and by submitting your project to our in-depth curation service you will increase the reputation of your project and make it more trustworthy for your launch contributors. Besides, you can easily run LBPs to eliminate front-running, bots and arbitrageurs, and conducting a fair price discovery while bootstrapping your initial liquidity. 

Prime Launch is also owned and operated by a DAO, PrimeDAO, which comes with a number of benefits (decentralization, stakeholder ownership, transparency).

### How is Prime Launch governed and operated? Who owns Prime Launch?

Prime Launch is owned and operated by PrimeDAO, which funded Prime Launch's development and appoints the signers on the Prime Launch multi-sig. The multi-sig is responsible for approving new launches to appear in the Prime Launch interface.

### How can I get in touch with the core Prime Launch team?

You can always reach out to us in the [PrimeDAO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG).

### **On which chains does Prime Launch operate?**

Currently, Prime Launch operates on Mainnet and Arbitrum. We are expanding to other chains in the near future (Celo and Gnosis Chain). Please check our [PrimeDAO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG) and the [PrimeDAO Announcement Telegram Channel](https://t.me/primedaonews) for these updates.

### **How does Prime Launch pricing work?**

- Prime Launch current service fee is 0%
- Transaction fees from contributors are accrued by the launch host
- At the moment, we are experimenting with an optional tipping fee (0%, 0.5%, 1% or 1.5%)

### **What are other services PrimeDAO provides?**

To complement Prime Launch, PrimeDAO also provides a wide range of support products and services to help projects start up successfully. 

With every launch, and for a value-added fee, the PrimeDAO Ecosystem Marketing & PR squad will help you craft the narrative around your launch, co-promote it and design assets for our and your marketing channels, and most importantly we will bring our partner DAOs into the mix to co-market your launch (i.e. BalancerDAO, GitcoinDAO, OlympusDAO, etc, depending on relevance to your product). This means that we will put the full force of our social media presence and our partnerships at your disposal. **Visit here for more detailed information on what our marketing services include**

Please reach out to us via the [PrimeDAO Discord](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG) or fill in our [Prime Launch Support Form](https://primedao.typeform.com/PrimeLaunchSup)

### What’s the main difference between Seed Launch and Liquid Launch (LBP)?

In short, **Seed Launch** is a simple way to host a decentralized token offering to raise early investments at a fixed price, and allows you to define a list of addresses that are allow to participate. On the other hand, **Liquid Launch** allows a project to conduct a fair market-based discovery of the token price and to boosts its already existing liquidity.

### What are Vesting Period & Cliff Period?

A vesting period is the amount of time, beginning after the cliff, during which a contributor's purchased tokens unlock linearly.

A cliff period is the amount of time during which contributors who have received tokens cannot transfer them.

### **What is the geo-block feature?**

The geo-block is an optional feature prevents a standard list of geographic locations from contributing to your launch. The restricted regions include Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia, Guyana, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, United States, United States Minor Outlying Islands, Venezuela, Yemen, and Crimea.

### What are the stages of a launch?

A launch can be:

- **UNINITIALIZED**: the launch has been accepted for launch and need to be funded by the admin.
- **PLANNED**: the launch has been funded is scheduled to go live at a certain date & time
- **LIVE**: the launch is on-going and it’s accepting contributions
- **PAUSED**: the launch is on-going but it’s temporarily paused
- **CLOSED** (only for SEED): the Seed launch is over or has been closed by the admin

### **What can a project admin do?**

The project admin can create a launch, determine the launch parameters, start the launch, pause the launch, fund the launch, and remove liquidity.

### **Who has access to the admin dashboard?**

Only the project admin has access to the admin dashboard. More specifically, the project admin has to be connected to the wallet address that was connected while submitting the launch application through the Prime Launch registration wizard.

### What’s the Maximum Project Token Supply?

The **Maximum Project Token Supply** is the maximum amount of project tokens to exist over the project's lifetime. If there is no maximum, you can provide a reasonable estimate.

### What’s the Project Token Distribution per Stakeholder Group?

The **Project Token Distribution per Stakeholder Group** is a table that defines the planned or already happened distribution of project tokens existing between different stakeholders. When setting up launch, projects who issue tokens in multiple rounds should clearly demarcate the amount of tokens distributed in each round by defining a Stakeholder Group for each of these rounds.

## SEED FAQ

### **What is an allowlist?**

An *allowlist* is the list of addresses that are allowed to contribute to a seed launch.

At Prime we’re excited that the world is adopting new words to transcend the ones that come from the world’s colonial heritage, that’s why we don’t use words like *blacklist* or *whitelist.*

### What is the Project Token Exchange Ratio?

Your **Project Token Exchange Ratio** is the proportion of value that you want to set with the funding token. For example, a 1.5 Project Token Exchange Ratio will provide 1 of your project’s token in exchange of 1.5 Funding Token to contributors of your Seed Launch.

### What is the Funding Tokens Target?

Your **Funding Tokens Target** is the minimum amount of funding tokens that you want to raise in your Seed Launch to deem it successful. If the Funding Target is not reached by the end of the seed duration, the contributors have the option to retrieve their contribution.

### What is the Funding Tokens Maximum?

The **Funding Tokens Maximum** is the maximum amount of funding tokens that you want to raise in the seed. Once the Funding Maximum is reached, the seed will automatically end and the vesting period, if there is one, will begin.

## LIQUID LAUNCH (LBP) FAQ

### What is a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) in Prime Launch?

A Liquid Launch is a public token offering that works by attempting to bootstrap the liquidity of a new token. Liquid Launches use Balancer v2's Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) to facilitate fair and efficient conditions for distributing tokens. The mechanism has been used dozens of times with [promising results.](https://medium.com/perpetual-protocol/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-liquidity-bootstrapping-pool-lbp-60a61b368c82)

Essentially, LBPs are liquidity pools that change weights over time throughout the sale period. As the weights change, they create selling pressure on the project token, leading to the price of a project token dropping if there is no buying pressure. So the pool is normally set to start with a relative high weight of project tokens (e.g. 95%) in respect of a relative small weight of funding tokens (e.g. 5% DAI). During the Liquid Launch, often 2 to 3 days, the pool weights are continuously rebalanced toward the funding token, which leads the project token's price to slowly decline. Contributors can participate at their preferred price point, while bots and arbitrageurs do not benefit from front-running (as buying early generally leads to overpaying).

The result is a fair and accessible token launch shown to effectively discover the market price of an asset and raise funds for the project team, without requiring prohibitive initial capital or enabling problematic front-running.

In practice, this means that contributors should avoid participating too early in Liquid Launches because the valuation will be high, and no price discovery has taken place. The closer to the end of the Liquid Launch, the project token has experienced more price discovery, creating a more stable conditions for new contributors.

For a complete breakdown of how Liquid Launches work on the back end, please read Balancer's [primer](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/a-primer-on-fair-token-launches-and-liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-11bab5ff33a2) or visit the [Balancer V2 Documentation](https://docs.balancer.fi/).

### What are pool weights in an LBP? How do I setup start and end weights?

LBP pool weights are expressed in percentage and are calculated based on the market value. Since the project token you are offering has no defined market value at the time of launching an LBP (most likely), this value is defined in proportion to the relative exposure with the funding token.

For example, with an LBP weight ratio of 2:98 (Funding Token:Project Token), if your upfront capital of funding token is 50K USDC, and your starting price is 10 USDC, the amount of tokens you can sell is [(50K / 0.02) / 10] = approx. 250K tokens. In contrast, if your upfront capital is 1M USDC, you’d be able to sell around 5M worth of tokens.

The price of your token will be discovered though market dynamics during the LBP, but when you define the start weights you are intrisically giving **your project’s tokens an initial value by collateralizing them.**

The general idea is to start with the pool weights heavily pitched towards your Project Token, and then gradually shift the weights towards the Funding (Collateral) asset by the end of the launch. In this way the majority of your Project Tokens end up being exchanged for the Funding (Collateral) Token you have chosen. By adjusting these parameters the sale can be set to keep the price more or less steady, or declining to a desired minimum (i.e. minimum price target).

Another important thing to keep in mind is that the lower you set the weights of the Funding (Collateral) asset in your LBP, the less upfront capital you would need to seed your launch. In a Prime LBP, the most pitched ratio in favor of your Project Token that you can set is 2:98, meaning that the pool composition will be 2% your Funding (Collateral) asset, and 98% the Project Token.

However, keep in mind that since the value of your Project Token is proportional to the value of the Funding (Collateral) Token you provide for the launch, the amount of funds you can raise in the launch is limited by the total value of the Funding (Collateral) Tokens you provide to the LBP.

To learn more about how LBP and weights work please refer to this primer on the [Balancer Documentation](https://docs.balancer.fi/v/v1/guides/smart-pool-templates-gui/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool).

Decide on critical parameters, such as LBP duration, starting and ending weights, and estimate the demand (i.e., expected sale rate), is extremely important. Balancer also provides a [LBP simulator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t6VsMJF8lh4xuH_rfPNdT5DM3nY4orF9KFOj2HdMmuY/edit?usp=sharing) that allow you to define these parameters according to your expectations. You can also reach out to us and we will help you out to understand and define the most strategic parameters for your launch.

### How does LBPs' constant downward price pressure works?

In essence, the constant downward price pressure in an LBP is algorithmically-defined in the smart contract that automatically adjust swap rates as time passes.

As we said, LBPs are liquidity pools that change weights over time throughout the sale period: from higher weights for project tokens to ideally meet the weight of the funding token. The weight determine the swap rate, so at the beginning the price will be relative high and contributors will be disincentivize to buy at that price, we call this *selling pressure* on the token. This is counterbalanced by the *buying pressure* generated by the automatic weight decrease encoded in the LBP smart contract: essentially, as time passes the project token weights decrease, increasing the desire for contributors to buy the project tokens.

### In short, w**hat is the process of an LBP launch on Prime Launch?**

1. The project owner fills in the launch parameters in the registration wizard (Project name, Project Description, cliff period, vesting period, Project Token Address, LBP start time and LBP end time, Start Weights, End Weights, etc) and submits the launch application.
2. The prime launch evaluation team will review your project and reach out to you within 10 days to understand your specific case and answer the questions you might have.
3. DAO-appointed Prime Launch multi-sig will take up to 5 days to approve or deny your launch submission.
4. If your launch is approved, it will be visible on the Prime Launch interface.
5. Once your launch is approved, the project admin has to fund the LBP with the specified project tokens and the funding tokens. This step requires your approval of three transactions.
6. At the start time of the LBP, when the weights are scheduled to start changing, the project admin has to enable swapping by clicking on “unpause swapping” on the admin dashboard.
    
    Please refer to the LBP Wizard Walkthrough to get a more detailed overview (TODO add anchor).
    

### **What to do at the end of the LBP?**

At the start time of the LBP, the project admin has to disable swapping by clicking on “pause swapping” on the admin dashboard. After that, the admin can remove liquidity and any unused project tokens through the admin dashboard.

### **When can the liquidity be removed?**

The project admin can remove liquidity after the LBP has ended.

### **How to pause an LBP? Why I would want to pause it?**

The project admin can pause the LBP through the admin dashboard by clicking on ‘Pause Swapping’. This action will disable purchasing from the Prime Launch interface but it will not stop the weights changing process, which are a function of time passing. If the LBP is paused after the LBP has started, the project admin can unpause the LBP on the admin dashboard at anytime.

### What multi-asset means in Liquid Launch?

It means that users can trade any token in exchange for the project token at the price of higher slippage.

See the walkthrough to set up a Liquid Launch (LBP) with the Wizard (TODO link)

# <!--SEED LAUNCH-->

A Seed Launch is a token offering by an early-stage project to a small group of contributors, in order to raise initial resources for the venture.

Seeds use a fixed swap function: contributors can swap the funding token for the seed token at a fixed, pre-determined price. Seeds specify a funding target: if the funding target is not met, contributors can reclaim their tokens.

Project teams may also specify (with an allowlist) which addresses will be allowed to contribute to their Seed. Seed Launches may also include a token vesting schedule for contributors, including both a cliff (lock) and a linear vesting period. This means the project team can specify:

- **Cliff**: an amount of time during which contributors who have received tokens cannot transfer them.
- **Vest**: an amount of time, beginning after the cliff, during which a contributor's purchased tokens unlock linearly.

To host a Seed Round on Prime Launch, see (TODO add anchor/link) Apply to host a Launch or head straight to the <a href="/register">application page</a>. To contribute to a launch, see <a href="/documentation/contribute-to-a-launch">Contribute to a Launch</a> or view all upcoming launches <a href="/launches">here</a>.

# <!--SEED LAUNCH WALKTHROUGH-->

## Connect with your wallet and start the wizard

1. Visit [https://launch.prime.xyz/register](https://launch.prime.xyz/register) (for Mainnet) [https://arbitrum.launch.prime.xyz](https://arbitrum.launch.prime.xyz/)/register (for Arbitrum).
2. Click on ‘Connect to a Wallet’ and accept the [Prime Launch Terms of Service](https://launch.prime.xyz/terms-of-service). Make sure you are connected to the intended network.
    - You need to have a compatible wallet set up. Prime Launch connects to most Ethereum wallets, including Metamask and all wallets compatible with WalletConnect. If you don't have an Ethereum wallet yet, set up a [Metamask account](https://metamask.io/) or use a WalletConnect-enabled mobile wallet like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/).
    - You will need to fund your wallet with some ETH for paying the transaction costs needed to setup the launch (~$25 worth of ETH is safe). Most wallets will give you instructions on how to acquire those tokens and ETH.

3. Click on ‘Start Seed’
4. Click on ‘Start Registration’.
    - In the future you will be able to choose between different Seed packages. At the moment only one is available (Basic).

## Setup your Project, Token, Seed and Contract Details

1. Be ready to provide the following **General Information:**
    - Project Name
    - Project Website
    - URL of the project’s Whitepaper
    - URL of the project’s Github repository
    - (optional) Links to the project’s Social Media pages
    
    Click ‘Next’ to move to the next section of the Wizard
    
2. Be ready to provide the following **Project Details:**
    - A short text to describe your project (max 200 characters). This short description will be visible to users on Featured Launch cards and the Launch Dashboard page.
    - A short text to describe why contributors should engage your project (max 300 characters). This will be will be prominently displayed on the Launch Dashboard page.
    - A short text describe the team behind the project (max 200 characters). Provide responsibilities and any useful background.
    
    Click ‘Next’ to move to the next section of the Wizard
    
3. Be ready to provide the following **Token Details:**
    - The native Ethereum address of the token you are offering to contributors.
    - The maximum supply of project tokens to exist over the project's lifetime. If there is no maximum, provide a reasonable estimate.
    - The project token distribution between different stakeholders. Click on ‘+ Add Stakeholder’ to add a new Stakeholder Group.
    - For each group you need to define the amount of token you plan to distribute (or that you have already distributed) to that Stakeholder Group, as well as the Vest and Cliff period (TODO: add link to glossary) for that group.
    
    ![https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-add-stakeholder_05JaC5qiN.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648833486931](https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-add-stakeholder_05JaC5qiN.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648833486931)
    
4. Projects who issue tokens in multiple rounds should clearly demarcate the amount of tokens distributed in each round, so for instance you can specify a group for each round.
This is an example of a Stakeholder Group table distribution.
    
    Click ‘Next’ to move to the next section of the Wizard
    
    ![https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-stakeholder-table_UhueFMnuR.png?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648834239823](https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-stakeholder-table_UhueFMnuR.png?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648834239823)
    
5. Next up, you will need to setup the **Seed Details** following these guidelines (you can [get in touch with us](https://primedao.typeform.com/PrimeLaunchSup) to understand how to better setup these details according to your strategy):
    - Select from the dropdown menu the **Funding Token** you want to raise, which is the token that your contributors will have to use to fund your Seed Launch in exchange your project’s tokens.
        - At the moment you can choose between Prime (D2D), Olympus (OHM), Governance OHM (gOHM), Dai Stablecoin (DAI), USD Coin (UDSC), Wrapped Ether (WETH).
    - Define your **Project Token Exchange Ratio** with the funding token. For example, a 1.5 Project Token Exchange Ratio will provide 1 of your project’s token in exchange of 1.5 Funding Token.
    - Define your **Funding Tokens Target** which specifies the minimum amount raised to consider the Seed Launch successful. If the Funding Target is not reached by the end of the seed duration, the contributors have the option to retrieve their contribution.
    - Define **Funding Tokens Maximum** which specifies the maximum amount to be raised in the Seed Launch. Once the Funding Maximum is reached, the seed will automatically end and the vesting period, if there is one, will begin.
    - Define the **Vesting Schedule** for the people that will participate as contributors in the Seed Launch. Input the duration in days in which the Project token is vested. Vesting is released linearly by default. The cliff is the period in which no tokens can be withdrawn or used — they are locked until this date. Please consider to set a starting date that is not sooner than 5 days from now as this will allow PrimeDAO to multisig approve this launch.
    - Define the **Seed Schedule** which is the period in which your Seed Launch will be open for contributions. The schedule can end before the End Date in the case your Seed Launch reaches the Funding Tokens Maximum.
6. (optional) If you want to allow specific address to contribute to your Seed Launch, add a URL to an **allowlist** in .csv format containing the list of addresses that are allowed to purchase Project tokens. The file must be formatted as plain text and each address must be separated from its neighbor addresses by one or more commas, spaces, tabs or carriage returns. Example using only commas:
    
    ```
    0x1234,0x5678,0xabcd,0x7890
    ```
    
7. (optional) If you want your contributors to sign a **legal disclaimer**, add a URL to a file containing the text of the disclaimer. If supplied, all contributors must accept the disclaimer in order to access the launch. The disclaimer must be formatted as plain text or Markdown. [(More info about Markdown)](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
8. (optional) Toggle the **Geoblock** in case you want to prevents the following list of geographic locations from contributing to your launch:

Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia, Guyana, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, United States, United States Minor Outlying Islands, Venezuela, Yemen, the Crimea.
9. Define the **Administrator wallet address**. The Seed Administrator has the ability to pause and close the seed, alter the allowlist and withdraw funding tokens.
You can define the address you’re connected to the website with by clicking ‘I will be the administrator’. Alternatively you can choose another address to be administrator by simply input that address in the Seed Administrator text field.

Click ‘Next’ to move to the next section of the Wizard
10. Define the **Contact Details** (e-mail address) and add any additional remarks that you might have for us.  

Click ‘Next’ to move to the next section of the Wizard, the **Seed Summary.**
11. You will see a recap of all the data you have input to setup your Seed Launch. Please thoroughly review the details of your seed submission before proceeding, as it’s your sole responsibility in case some details are wrong.

Click ‘Proceed’ to move to the final section of the Wizard.
12. In the last section of the Wizard you will be asked to:
    - Read carefully
    - Tick the boxes to agree to the [Prime Launch Terms of Service](https://launch.prime.xyz/terms-of-service), to confirm that you have reviewed the details of your launch submission (in the previous step) and they are correct, and that you have read the [Privacy Policy](https://launch.prime.xyz/terms-of-service), including the [Prime Launch Cookie Use](https://launch.prime.xyz/terms-of-service).
    - Click on ‘Submit’ to create a request for creation of the Seed that will be reviewed by PrimeDAO and subsequently displayed in the Prime Launch interface. The approval takes place in the [Prime Launch multisig wallet](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/rin:0x2E46E481d57477A0663a7Ec61E7eDc65F4cb7F5C/transactions) and generally take 5-7 days.
    - Confirm the contract interaction in your wallet and awaits confirmation.
    - You will be redirected to a page that provides you with the Seed configuration stored in the JSON format in IPFS. **Please save this URL as it can allow us to debug potential problem. Note that it takes a moment to generate the JSON file on IPFS so be patient.**
13. Once approved, we will inform you to your contact e-mail and the Seed Admin will have to fund the Seed with the correct amount of project tokens. The amount of project tokens to fund is calculated as **Funding Tokens Maximum** divided by **Project Token Exchange Ratio** plus the fee (which at the moment is 0% for all launches). In order to fund you need to connect with the Seed Administrator wallet to the [Admin Dashboard](https://launch.prime.xyz/admin/seeds/dashboard).
After adding the funds, the Seed is initialized. The Seed will automatically be live and available for people to contribute on your start date.

# <!--LIQUID LAUNCH-->

A Liquid Launch is a public token offering that works by attempting to bootstrap the liquidity of a new token. Liquid Launches use Balancer V2's Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) to facilitate fair and efficient environments for distributing tokens. The mechanism has been utilized dozens of times with [promising results](https://medium.com/perpetual-protocol/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-liquidity-bootstrapping-pool-lbp-60a61b368c82).

In the back end, a Liquid Launch is an adjustable Balancer V2 pool designed for initial distribution and price discovery of a new asset. The pool will generally start with a high weight of project tokens (e.g. 95%) and a small weight of funding tokens (e.g. 5% DAI). During the Liquid Launch, often 2 to 3 days, the pool weights are continuously rebalanced toward the funding token, which leads the project token's price to slowly decline. Contributors can participate at their preferred price point, while bots and arbitrageurs do not benefit from front-running (as buying early generally leads to overpaying).

The result is a fair and accessible token launch shown to effectively discover the market price of an asset and raise funds for the project team, without requiring prohibitive initial capital or enabling problematic front-running.

For a complete breakdown of how Liquid Launches work on the back end, please read Balancer's [primer](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/a-primer-on-fair-token-launches-and-liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-11bab5ff33a2) or visit the [Balancer V2 Documentation](https://docs.balancer.fi/).

To host a Liquid Launch, see <a href="/documentation/host-a-launch">Apply to host a Launch</a> or head straight to the <a href="/register">application page</a>. To contribute to a launch, see <a href="/documentation/contribute-to-a-launch">Contribute to a Launch</a> or view all upcoming launches <a href="/launches">here</a>.

# <!--LIQUID LAUNCH (LPB) WALKTHROUGH-->

## Connect with your wallet and start the wizard

1. Visit [https://launch.prime.xyz/register](https://launch.prime.xyz/register) (for Mainnet) [https://arbitrum.launch.prime.xyz](https://arbitrum.launch.prime.xyz/)/register (for Arbitrum).
2. Click on ‘Connect to a Wallet’ and accept the [Prime Launch Terms of Service](https://launch.prime.xyz/terms-of-service). Make sure you are connected to the intended network.
    - You need to have a compatible wallet set up. Prime Launch connects to most Ethereum wallets, including Metamask and all wallets compatible with WalletConnect. If you don't have an Ethereum wallet yet, set up a [Metamask account](https://metamask.io/) or use a WalletConnect-enabled mobile wallet like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/).
    - You will need to fund your wallet with some ETH for paying the transaction costs needed to setup the launch (~$25 worth of ETH is safe). Most wallets will give you instructions on how to acquire those tokens and ETH.

3. Click on ‘Start LBP’
4. Click on ‘Start Registration’.
    - In the future you will be able to choose between different LBP packages. At the moment only the *Basic* package is available.

## Setup your Project, Token, LBP and Contract Details

1. Be ready to provide the following **General Information:**
    - Project Name
    - Project Website
    - URL of the project’s Whitepaper
    - URL of the project’s Github repository
    - (optional) Links to the project’s Social Media pages
    
    Click ‘Next’ to move to the next section of the Wizard
    
2. Be ready to provide the following **Project Details:**
    - A short text to describe your project (max 200 characters). This short description will be visible to users on Featured Launch cards and the Launch Dashboard page.
    - A short text to describe why contributors should engage your project (max 300 characters). This will be will be prominently displayed on the Launch Dashboard page.
    - A short text describe the team behind the project (max 200 characters). Provide responsibilities and any useful background.
    
    Click ‘Next’ to move to the next section of the Wizard
    
3. Be ready to provide the following **Token Details:**
    - The native Ethereum address of the token you are offering to contributors.
    - The maximum supply of project tokens to exist over the project's lifetime. If there is no maximum, provide a reasonable estimate.
    - The project token distribution between different stakeholders. Click on ‘+ Add Stakeholder’ to add a new Stakeholder Group.
    - For each group you need to define the amount of token you plan to distribute (or that you have already distributed) to that Stakeholder Group, as well as the Vest and Cliff period (TODO: add link to glossary) for that group.
    
    ![https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-add-stake.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648834470125](https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-add-stake.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648834470125)
    
4. Projects who issue tokens in multiple rounds should clearly demarcate the amount of tokens distributed in each round, so for instance you can specify a group for each round.
This is an example of a Stakeholder Group table distribution.

    Click ‘Next’ to move to the next section of the Wizard
    
5. Next up, you will need to setup the **Liquid Launch Details** following these guidelines (you can [get in touch with us](https://primedao.typeform.com/PrimeLaunchSup) to understand how to better setup these details according to your strategy):
    - Select from the dropdown menu the **Funding Token** you want to raise, which is the token that your contributors will have to use to fund your LBP Launch in exchange your project’s tokens.
    
    At the moment you can choose between Prime (D2D), Olympus (OHM), Governance OHM (gOHM), Dai Stablecoin (DAI), USD Coin (UDSC), Wrapped Ether (WETH).
    - Define the total amount of Project Tokens that you will provide to the LBP and the total amount of Funding (Collateral) Tokens that will be supplied to set up your Liquid Launch.
    - Define the Start & End Date and Time as well as the Start & End Weights of your Liquid Launch.
6. LBPs leverage a dynamic weighting that shifts throughout the pool’s lifespan, finding a fair market value by starting at a relatively higher price and lowering the price over time by adjusting the weight ratios if there are no purchases.

The general idea is to start with the pool weights heavily pitched towards your Project Token, and then gradually shift the weights towards the Funding (Collateral) asset by the end of the launch. In this way the majority of your Project Tokens end up being exchanged for the Funding (Collateral) Token you have chosen. By adjusting these parameters the sale can be set to keep the price more or less steady, or declining to a desired minimum (i.e. minimum price target).

Another important thing to keep in mind is that the lower you set the weights of the Funding (Collateral) asset in your LBP, the less upfront capital you would need to seed your launch. In a Prime Liquid Launch, the most pitched ratio in favor of your Project Token that you can set is 2:98, meaning that the pool composition will be 2% your Funding (Collateral) asset, and 98% the Project Token.

However, keep in mind that since the value of your Project Token is proportional to the value of the Funding (Collateral) Token you provide for the launch, the amount of funds you can raise in the launch is limited by the total value of the Funding (Collateral) Tokens you provide to the LBP.

For example, with an LBP weight ratio of 2:98 (Funding Token:Project Token), if your upfront capital is 50K USDC, and your starting price is 10 USDC, the amount of tokens you can sell is [(50K / 0.02) / 10] = approx. 250K tokens. In contrast, if your upfront capital is 1M USDC, you’d be able to sell around 5M worth of tokens.

To learn more about how LBP and weights work please refer to this primer on the [Balancer Documentation](https://docs.balancer.fi/v/v1/guides/smart-pool-templates-gui/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool).

Decide on critical parameters, such as LBP duration, starting and ending weights, and estimate the demand (i.e., expected sale rate), is extremely important. Balancer also provides a [LBP simulator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t6VsMJF8lh4xuH_rfPNdT5DM3nY4orF9KFOj2HdMmuY/edit?usp=sharing) that allow you to define these parameters according to your expectations. You can also reach out to us and we will help you out to understand and define the most strategic parameters for your launch.
7. You can further consult the automatically generated chart in which you can find details on important statistics of the Project Token such as the price and fee percentage. **Implied Market Capitalization** displays the implied market valuation if all Project Tokens are part of the circulating supply. **Price Range** displays the lowest and highest price of the Project Token (in USD) during the launch period. Make sure that this chart reflects your expectations.
So basically what you are doing here is giving **your project’s tokens an initial value by collateralizing them and selecting a start weight.**
8. (optional) If you want your contributors to sign a legal disclaimer, add a URL to a file containing the text of the disclaimer. If supplied, all contributors must accept the disclaimer in order to access the launch. The disclaimer must be formatted as plain text or Markdown. [(More info about Markdown)](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
9. (optional) Toggle the Geoblock in case you want to prevents the following list of geographic locations from contributing to your launch:

Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia, Guyana, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, United States, United States Minor Outlying Islands, Venezuela, Yemen, the Crimea. 7. Define the Administrator wallet address. 
10. The LBP Administrator has the ability to pause and close the LBP, alter the allowlist and withdraw funding tokens.

You can define the address you’re connected to the website with by clicking ‘I will be the administrator’. Alternatively you can choose another address to be administrator by simply input that address in the LBP Administrator text field.

14. Once approved, we will inform you to your contact e-mail and and the Liquid Launch Administrator will have to fund the LBP with the Project Token and the Funding (Collateral) Tokens previously defined. This can be done by connecting the Liquid Launch Admin wallet to the [Admin Dashboard](https://ethereum-dev-launch-prime.vercel.app/admin/lbps/dashboard)
15. After adding the funds, the LBP will become available in the Prime Launch UI on the start date that you set. However, please note that LBP swapping will be in a "paused" state until, as the LBP administrator, you unpause it to open up swapping. At close time, to ensure an accurate LBP launch, you will need to pause the LBP to turn off swapping. You can also do this in the [Admin Dashboard](https://launch.prime.xyz/admin/lbps/dashboard).

# <!--CONTRIBUTE TO A LAUNCH-->

To contribute to a launch and receive project tokens in exchange of funding tokens, follow the steps outlined below.

1. To see upcoming or live launches that you might want to contribute to visit [https://launch.prime.xyz/launches](https://launch.prime.xyz/launches) (for Mainnet) [https://arbitrum.launch.prime.xyz/launches](https://arbitrum.launch.prime.xyz/launches) (for Arbitrum)
2. Click on ‘Connect to a Wallet’ and accept the [Prime Launch Terms of Service](https://launch.prime.xyz/terms-of-service). Make sure you are connected to the intended network.
    - You need to have a compatible wallet set up. Prime Launch connects to most Ethereum wallets, including Metamask and all wallets compatible with WalletConnect. If you don't have an Ethereum wallet yet, set up a [Metamask account](https://metamask.io/) or use a WalletConnect-enabled mobile wallet like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/).
    
    ![https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-contribute-wallet_akpdrixbo.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648834954728](https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-contribute-wallet_akpdrixbo.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648834954728)
    
    - The first time you connect to the Prime Launch website with a new wallet you will be required to accept the [Prime Launch Terms of Service Disclaimer](https://launch.prime.xyz/terms-of-service).
    
    [https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-tos-600_3_i1RVNhi_?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648835406846](https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-tos-600_3_i1RVNhi_?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648835406846)
    
3. Next up, you will need to fund your wallet with some of the tokens you want to contribute to the Launch (funding tokens) and some ETH for paying transaction costs (~$25 worth of ETH is safe). Most wallets will give you instructions on how to acquire those tokens and ETH.
4. On the <a href="/launches">Launches page</a>, you can view the upcoming launches and see which funding tokens the project is accepting in its launch.
    - Make sure to DYOR (Do Your Own Research) on the project you want to fund, starting from the links attached to the Launch in the About section of the launch page
    - Make sure you read the project’s disclaimer if there is one
    - Make sure you are eligible to participate as a contributor to the launch.

## Contribute to a Seed Launch

To contribute to a Seed Launch, you must hold some of the launch's funding token.

1. In the "Contribute" box, exchange the funding tokens for rights to claim a fixed amount of the project token when the launch ends. Contributors can claim back the funding tokens they contributed anytime before the launch ends (but will lose rights to claim project tokens if they do).
    
    [https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-contribute_pUo_fQKxZz?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648822915570](https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-contribute_pUo_fQKxZz?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648822915570)
    
2. Note that Seed Launches end when the maximum funding is reached or the contribution time window is over (whether or not the funding target is reached). If the launch ends and the funding target has not been reached, no project tokens will be distributed and contributors can reclaim their funding tokens.

If the funding target or the maximum funding is reached, contributors can claim project tokens in the "Claim" box after the launch ends.
    
    [https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-claim-600_5OsJ_EV7DR?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648822810453](https://ik.imagekit.io/primedao/Launch_Tutorial_Gifs/launch-claim-600_5OsJ_EV7DR?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1648822810453)
    
    Note, however, that many Seed Launches will have vesting periods with cliffs and/or vesting time:
    
    - Cliff: a period of time before any tokens can be claimed
    - Vest: a period of time following the cliff during which tokens will be unlocked linearly
    
    For example, take a Seed Launch with a 3 day cliff and a 10 day vest. A contributor who has contributed enough to claim 10 tokens will have to wait 3 days for the cliff, after which their 10 tokens will unlock gradually over the next 10 days.
    

## Contributing to a Liquid Launch

To contribute to a Liquid Launch, you must have any token with liquidity on the Balancer Protocol, for example, ETH, DAI, USDC, or D2D.

- In the "Contribute" box on the right of the screen, connect with your wallet and accept the Prime Launch Terms of Service. Afterward, select the token and amount you would want to exchange for the project token and click the approve button in the Contribute box to start the transaction to approve these tokens to be spent inside Prime Launch. Once confirmed, you can now click on Contribute, which will begin the transaction to swap your tokens for the project's tokens.

In the current landscape many launchpads tried to provide extra in-house services to launching projects in house. However, instead of providing every service by ourselves, with Prime Launch we embraced a more ecosystemic approach and made sure that launching projects could get the best support with highly specialized, top quality service provider partners. Along with better quality service, through the collaborative approach in service partnership, we introduced newly emerging projects to growing DAO to DAO ecosystem which would be vital in their growth in later stages of journey.

## Smart Contract Audits

Security is becoming more and more of a challenge, especially in the blockchain space. byterocket's comprehensive Smart Contract Audit Service empowers startups to enterprises to launch and maintain their blockchain applications.

### Avoid Devastating Errors

Prevention is the best antidote. If you choose to audit your code early in the development lifecycle, you get to prevent devastating vulnerabilities and complex issues after launch. ‍ byterocket provides you with a comprehensive and complete report immediately after performing our Smart Contract Audit, containing vulnerability details and mitigation guidance.

### Experience Beats Everything

Byterocket been working with Smart Contracts on Ethereum since early 2017, so they've got their fair share of experience. they always strive to stay on top of current developments by being an active part of the Ethereum community. Working closely with various independent security researchers, byterocket constantly explores new ways to ensure your Smart Contract's safety.

## The Audit Process

### Manual Review & Analysis

Multiple auditors go through the smart contract code - line by line - looking for bugs and potential vulnerabilities. They profoundly analyse the implemented logic and its implementation.

### Tools & Testnets

Having concluded a manual analysis, they then leverage state-of-the-art software to analyse and test your code even further, including methods like fuzz-testing. Additionally, they deploy your smart contracts to a testnet to see how it behaves in reality.

### Final Discussion

Having finished the review and analysis independently, our auditors now internally discuss their findings and go through the code once more. The discussion includes possible attack vectors and challenging the protocol in theory and practice.
